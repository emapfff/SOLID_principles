# Description:
## Task 2.1 :
- Context: The code implements a simple payroll system that calculates the salaries of employees based on their hours worked and their type (hourly or salaried).
## Task 2.2 :
- Context: The code simulates a typical “is-a” inheritance relationship between a Square and a Rectangle. A Square is a Rectangle with four equal sides. A Rectangle is characterized by a length and a width.
## Task 3 :
The attributes in the ProcessData class represent process ID (PID), the shared memory
by the given process, the virtual memory used by the given process, the amount of
CPU used by the given process, the name of the owner of the given task, NI for a nice
value of the task, and permissions which are usually associated with user applications,
for instance, a user application cannot read or write to a file if it does not have the
given permission granted. CPU usage and memory are also associated with user
applications in order to make sure that the user applications are running well without
blocking the server due to abnormal behaviors (such as attacks).
### Please consider the following constraints:
- ● The Logging class writes only once to the file.
- ● In the future, we may add other classes for monitoring.
- ● The class ProcessData has many attributes, so avoid using a constructor with a lot of parameters.
